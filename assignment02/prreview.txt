table 1: 
- Looks great! I inputted it on my terminal and it gave no errors. 
- batting averages are usually calculated up to the 3rd decimal, you might be able to round it! 

table 2:
-   This looks great as well! 
- The batter counts also includes game_id and batter, might be simpler to just use those two tables (game for local date and batter counts)


table 3:
- This is a great table to condense data! 

table 4: 
- I like the use of the case statement to eliminate issues with divisions of 0. 
- This also looks great! I like the usuage of the temporary tables to utilize this data. 
- I attempted to run this last table but it won't load, it might just take extra long to process.
